**Top Performance Issues:**

1. **Missing Indexes** - Sequential scans are expensive
   - Solution: Add indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Expected improvement: 70-90% faster queries

2. **Inefficient JOINs** - Wrong join order or missing foreign key indexes
   - Solution: Index foreign key columns and optimize join conditions
   - Expected improvement: 60-80% faster

3. **Large Result Sets** - Returning too much data
   - Solution: Add pagination, filtering, or result limiting
   - Expected improvement: 50-70% faster

Would you like me to analyze a specific slow query for you?`

      response = `Great question! Here's my index strategy for your database:

**High Priority Indexes:**
\`\`\`sql
-- For user lookups by creation date
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users (created_at);

-- For post filtering and joins
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_user_status ON posts (user_id, status);

-- For comment aggregations  
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_post_id ON comments (post_id);
\`\`\`

**Index Best Practices:**
• Put most selective columns first in composite indexes
• Avoid over-indexing (impacts write performance)
• Monitor index usage with database statistics
• Consider partial indexes for filtered queries

Expected performance improvement: 60-85% faster queries!`

    } else if (lowerMessage.includes("join") || lowerMessage.includes("joins")) {
      response = `JOIN optimization is crucial for performance! Let me help:

**Common JOIN Issues:**
1. **Missing foreign key indexes** - Always index FK columns
2. **Wrong join order** - Filter early, join late
3. **Cartesian products** - Ensure proper join conditions

**Optimization Strategy:**
\`\`\`sql
-- Inefficient: Large table scan first
SELECT * FROM large_table l JOIN small_table s ON l.id = s.large_id;

-- Better: Filter first, then join
SELECT * FROM small_table s JOIN large_table l ON s.large_id = l.id 
WHERE s.active = true;
\`\`\`

**Performance Tips:**
• Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries
• Consider denormalization for frequently joined data
• Use appropriate join types (INNER vs LEFT)

Expected improvement: 70-85% faster execution!`

**Query Optimization:**
- Analyzing slow queries and execution plans
- Suggesting better query structures and indexes
- Identifying bottlenecks and performance issues

- Setting up performance alerts
- Tracking query performance over time
- Database health monitoring

**Best Practices:**
- Schema design recommendations
- Caching strategies and implementation
- Scaling and optimization techniques
